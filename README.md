# Pixel - Image Size Reducer

Pixel is an application aimed at reducing the size of images while maintaining their quality. It utilizes advanced algorithms to compress images without significant loss in visual fidelity. This tool is particularly useful for individuals and businesses looking to optimize their websites, emails, or storage space by reducing the file size of images.

## General Information
Pixel employs sophisticated compression techniques, including Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), to efficiently reduce the size of images. By leveraging mathematical principles, Pixel ensures that the compressed images retain as much detail as possible while minimizing file size.

## Technologies Used
* **numpy v.1.21.4**: for matrix operations and mathematical computations
* **Pillow v.8.4.0**: for image processing tasks such as reading, saving, and manipulating images
* **Flask v.2.0.2**: for creating a user-friendly web interface and handling backend operations
* **Bootstrap v5.1.3**: for designing a responsive and visually appealing front-end interface

## Features
Pixel offers several features to users:
* Image compression with adjustable compression levels (0-100%)
* Display of final data usage percentage and program runtime
* Download option for the compressed image
* Support for various image formats and color modes
